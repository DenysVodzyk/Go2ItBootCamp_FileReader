My dog Sally is so smart she can jump over logs, do tricks for food, hunt for rats and bark. What can your dog do? I bet she canâ€™t do all that! I bet your dog can't even climb trees... Sally is able to sleep all day, greet me 
like I just won the lottery, eat the same basic food day after day and stay happy even when I am grumpy. She is the best dog in the WHOLE WORLD!!
